Neural Transfer Learning For Soil Liquefaction Tests
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>This code is developed to transfer learning across different soil liquefaction test (Vs, CPT, CPT, and SPT)</li>
  <li>The main model (aka: the pre-trained model) is built using the comprehensive Vs test dataset for different sources including two features (Vs1 and CSR)</li>
  <li>The knowledge gained why classifying soil liquefaction using Vs test dataset is reused for CPT, SPT, and DPT as starting point and 20% of each test is used to fine-tune the pre-trained model</li>
</ul>
